## D1

R Graphics devices are somewhat sparsely documented:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Graphics-Devices

graphics.h
GraphicsDevice.h


OmegaHat had some docs as well:
[RGraphicsDevice](http://www.omegahat.net/RGraphicsDevice/overview.html)


It's somewhat helpful to look at a more modern implementation (eg with Rcpp):
[svglite](https://github.com/r-lib/svglite/blob/master/src/devSVG.cpp)

## D2

Removing device for now to get early testing.

Rstudio has a dummy driver also:

[RShadowPNGGraphicsHandler.cpp](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/master/src/cpp/r/session/graphics/RShadowPngGraphicsHandler.cpp)

## D3

mode(1) is called on device on each drawing op - can shim that onto a png device.

see mode.c for new mode function, and shim for adding it to existing png device.  State is being saved in an unused bit.

## D3.2

By registering a Task Callback, we can plot if needed. 

* Register on package attach, deregister on unattach.
