R Graphics devices are somewhat sparsely documented:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#Graphics-Devices

graphics.h
GraphicsDevice.h


OmegaHat had some docs as well:
http://www.omegahat.net/RGraphicsDevice/overview.html


It's somewhat helpful to look at a more modern implementation (eg with Rcpp):
https://github.com/r-lib/svglite/blob/master/src/devSVG.cpp
